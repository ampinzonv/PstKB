* Created the "Rosetta" sheet in the modelData.xls file. I use it to finish organizing and curating the data processed in the Jupyter Notebook.

* Created a new sheet in the excel file modelData.xls named "biomass3.1". This is to pass it through the Jupyter Notebook to separate and create data frames.
* Created the Extra folder, where the ModeloPython.ipynb file, a Jupyter Notebook, is located. I use it to work with the excel data. There are also several auxiliary files resulting from tests I am conducting.

* Created new tab "biomass3" to create Guevara`s OF.
* Assigned new fractions to Biomass3, by mapping PstKB to Guevara`s included dATP,dCTP and dGTP.

* Assesed the original Biomass OF in this model.
* Rename spreadsheet from PlantHeterothrophic to modelData. To better reflect new content.
* Depicted components of OF to be compared against old Pst old models.
* TODO: add a new OF containing the fractions from Guevara's work.

* Created a XLS version of the PstKB model: PstKB_cobra.
* Created a biomass3 tab.
* Some biomass fractions modified (H2O, ATP)
